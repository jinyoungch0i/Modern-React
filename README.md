# Modern-React

React is constantly evolving. 

In order to cement my growing knowledge of the React library, and keep up-to-date on latest trends and best practices, I created `Modern-React` as a reference material for the future. 

At the time of creation, the data for `Modern-React` is initialised as a `links.js` file composed of 7 objects in the `linksData` array:

1) React Context API - https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html

3) render props - https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html
4) Higher Order Components - https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html
